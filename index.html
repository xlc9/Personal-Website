        <h2 class="artist"> The Strokes</h2>
        <p class="limit">The Strokes are an American rock band from New York City.
            Formed in 1998, the band is composed of lead singer and songwriter Julian Casablancas, guitarists Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond Jr., bassist Nikolai Fraiture, and drummer Fabrizio Moretti.
            They were a leading group of the early-2000s indie rock revival.
            The release of their EP The Modern Age in early 2001 sparked a bidding war among major labels, with the band eventually signing to RCA Records. 
            That summer, they released their debut album, Is This It, to critical acclaim and strong sales. It has since appeared on numerous "best album" lists.
            It was followed by Room on Fire (2003) and First Impressions of Earth (2005), both of which sold well but failed to match Is This It in critical success.</p>
